            plan online, receive the QR code via email, and scan it with your smartphone. The entire process takes just 
            minutes, and you'll have high-speed 4G and 5G connectivity throughout your stay in Makkah, Madinah, and all of

            How Does eSIM Work for Umrah Travelers?
          </h3>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            An eSIM (embedded SIM) is a digital SIM card built into modern smartphones. For Umrah and Hajj pilgrims, this 
            means you can activate a Saudi Arabia mobile data plan without removing your home country SIM card. Your device 
            can use both SIMs simultaneously - keep your home number active for calls and texts while using the eSIM for 
            mobile data in Saudi Arabia. This is particularly useful for pilgrims who need to stay in touch with family 
            back home while using data for maps, WhatsApp, and other internet services during their pilgrimage.

            Instant Activation for Makkah and Madinah
          </h3>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Our <strong>eSIM plans for Umrah</strong> work seamlessly in <strong>Makkah</strong>, <strong>Madinah</strong>, 
            and throughout <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>. Whether you're performing Umrah rituals at the Kaaba, visiting 
            historical sites in Madinah, or traveling between cities, our high-speed <strong>4G and 5G networks</strong> 
            ensure you're always connected. The eSIM activates automatically when you arrive in Saudi Arabia, so you have 
            internet access from the moment you land.
